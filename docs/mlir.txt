Excellent question! This is actually a crucial architectural decision for your deep learning compiler. Let me help you understand the relationship between LLVM and MLIR, and which makes more sense for your project.
Understanding the LLVM vs MLIR Relationship
Think of LLVM and MLIR as different levels of a compiler construction toolkit, not competing technologies. Here's how they relate:
LLVM IR is a single-level representation that's close to machine code. When you write:
python# your current approach
product = self.builder.fmul(input_val, weight_val)
acc_val = self.builder.load(acc)
new_acc = self.builder.fadd(acc_val, product)
You're manually translating a high-level concept (matrix multiplication) into low-level operations (individual floating-point multiplies and adds).
MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is a framework for building compilers with multiple levels of abstraction. It was specifically created to solve the problems you're encountering in deep learning compilers.
What MLIR Would Give You
MLIR provides dialects (domain-specific sub-languages) that operate at different abstraction levels. For your neural network compiler, you could work with operations like:
mlir// high-level neural network operations
%result = "linalg.matmul"(%input, %weights) : (tensor<?x?xf32>, tensor<?x?xf32>) -> tensor<?x?xf32>
%activated = "linalg.elemwise_unary"(%result) {op = "relu"} : (tensor<?x?xf32>) -> tensor<?x?xf32>

// instead of manually coding hundreds of lines of nested loops
These high-level operations can then be progressively lowered through multiple stages:

High-level dialect: linalg.matmul, linalg.conv2d
Loop dialect: Structured loops with bounds and iteration spaces
Affine dialect: Optimized loop nests with mathematical transformations
LLVM dialect: The same LLVM IR you're currently generating manually

Comparing Your Current Approach vs MLIR
Let me show you the difference using your conv2d implementation as an example.
Your current LLVM approach (what you have now):
python# you manually implement all 6 nested loops
for oc in range(out_channels):
    for oh in range(out_h):
        for ow in range(out_w):
            for ic in range(in_channels):
                for kh in range(kh):
                    for kw in range(kw):
                        # manual address calculation
                        # manual bounds checking  
                        # manual accumulation
MLIR approach (what you could have):
mlir// high-level operation
%conv = linalg.conv_2d 
  ins(%input, %filter : tensor<?x?x?x?xf32>, tensor<?x?x?x?xf32>)
  outs(%output : tensor<?x?x?x?xf32>)

// mlir automatically generates optimized loops
// handles tiling, vectorization, fusion
The MLIR compiler infrastructure would automatically generate the same optimized loops you're manually coding, but with much more sophisticated optimization passes.
The Fusion Story
Remember how you implemented fusion by detecting patterns and creating fused operations? MLIR has built-in transformation passes that do this automatically:
mlir// before fusion
%conv = linalg.conv_2d ins(%input, %filter) outs(%temp)
%relu = linalg.elemwise_unary(%temp) {op = "relu"} -> %output

// after automatic fusion pass
%fused = linalg.conv_2d ins(%input, %filter) outs(%output) {epilogue = "relu"}
MLIR's fusion passes are far more sophisticated than pattern matching - they can analyze data dependencies, memory usage, and hardware constraints to make optimal fusion decisions.
Should You Switch to MLIR?
This depends on your project goals and timeline. Let me break down the considerations:
Arguments for MLIR:

Higher-level abstractions: You'd work with neural network operations instead of manual loop generation
Sophisticated optimizations: Built-in passes for tiling, vectorization, fusion that are more advanced than manual implementations
Multiple targets: The same high-level representation can generate code for different architectures (ARM, x86, GPU)
Future-proofing: MLIR is becoming the standard for ML compiler infrastructure

Arguments for staying with LLVM:

Simpler mental model: You understand exactly what code is being generated
Working implementation: Your current approach already generates functional code
Learning curve: MLIR has significant complexity - dialects, conversion patterns, transformation passes
Project scope: For a focused PyTorch-to-STM32 converter, LLVM might be sufficient

The Evolution Path
Here's how I'd think about this decision:
Phase 1 (Current): Your LLVM approach gives you deep understanding of code generation fundamentals. You're learning how neural networks map to hardware - this knowledge is invaluable.
Phase 2 (Potential): If you want to expand beyond STM32, support more layer types, or generate more sophisticated optimizations, MLIR becomes compelling.
Think of it like learning to cook. Your LLVM approach is like learning to prepare ingredients from scratch - you understand every step. MLIR is like having a professional kitchen with specialized tools - more powerful, but you need to understand the tools first.
A Concrete Example: Your Linear Layer
Your current LLVM implementation:
python# 50+ lines of manual loop generation
def build_linear_layer_ir_simd(self, config, input_ptr, input_size, output_ptr):
    # manual vectorization logic
    # manual memory layout decisions
    # manual accumulation patterns
Equivalent MLIR representation:
mlir%result = linalg.matmul ins(%input, %weights : tensor<?xf32>, tensor<?x?xf32>) 
                       outs(%output : tensor<?xf32>)
But here's the key insight: Your current work isn't wasted. Understanding how to manually generate these patterns makes you a better MLIR user. You'll understand what the high-level transformations are actually doing.
My Recommendation
For your current project, I'd suggest continuing with LLVM for these reasons:

Learning value: You're building fundamental understanding of how neural networks map to hardware
Focused scope: PyTorch-to-STM32 is well-suited to direct code generation
Working solution: Your approach is generating functional optimized code

However, consider MLIR for future projects if you want to:

Support multiple target architectures
Handle more complex neural network operations (attention, normalization layers)
Build a more general-purpose ML compiler

Think of your current LLVM work as building the foundation knowledge that will make you effective with MLIR later. You're learning the "assembly language" of neural network compilation - this understanding will make you much more effective when you eventually work with higher-level tools.
Would you like me to show you how your current linear layer implementation would look in MLIR, just to illustrate the difference in abstraction levels?
